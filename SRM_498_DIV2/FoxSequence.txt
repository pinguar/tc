PROBLEM STATEMENT
Fox Ciel likes sequences.  One day, she invented a new type of sequence and named it the fox sequence.  A sequence seq containing N elements is called a fox sequence if and only if there exist four integers a, b, c and d such that 0 < a < b <= c < d < N-1 and the following five conditions are met:

seq[0], seq[1], ... , seq[a] forms an arithmetic progression with a positive common difference.  An arithmetic progression is a sequence where the difference between successive elements is equal.  The difference between successive elements is called the common difference.  Note that 0 is neither positive nor negative.
seq[a], seq[a+1], ... , seq[b] forms an arithmetic progression with a negative common difference.
seq[b], seq[b+1], ... , seq[c] are all equal.
seq[c], seq[c+1], ... , seq[d] forms an arithmetic progression with a positive common difference.
seq[d], seq[d+1], ... , seq[N-1] forms an arithmetic progression with a negative common difference.


In the following image, the top 3 sequences are fox sequences, while the bottom 3 sequences are not:



You are given a sequence seq.  Return "YES" if it is a fox sequence, or "NO" if it is not (all quotes for clarity).

DEFINITION
Class:FoxSequence
Method:isValid
Parameters:vector <int>
Returns:string
Method signature:string isValid(vector <int> seq)


CONSTRAINTS
-seq will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.
-Each element of seq will be between 1 and 2,000, inclusive.


EXAMPLES

0)
{1,3,5,7,5,3,1,1,1,3,5,7,5,3,1}


Returns: "YES"

This is the top-left sequence of the image shown in the statement.  The next five examples are also from that image.

1)
{1,2,3,4,5,4,3,2,2,2,3,4,5,6,4}


Returns: "YES"



2)
{3,6,9,1,9,5,1}


Returns: "YES"



3)
{1,2,3,2,1,2,3,2,1,2,3,2,1}


Returns: "NO"



4)
{1,3,4,3,1,1,1,1,3,4,3,1}


Returns: "NO"



5)
{6,1,6}


Returns: "NO"
