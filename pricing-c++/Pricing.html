<html><head><title>Pricing</title></head><body  ><table><tr><td colspan="2"><h3>Problem Statement</h3></td></tr><tr><td>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</td><td>Market differentiation in its simplest form is a system of charging different
prices to different customers for the same product.  To maximize the total
sales revenue, we would like to charge each customer individually, charging the 
highest price that that customer would be willing to pay.  Usually we have 
to divide the customers into a few groups, and charge the same 
price to everyone in a group (e.g. business class, economy class, etc.).
<p>
We have a list of all the potential customers for our product and the most 
that each customer is willing to pay.  We have decided to differentiate them 
into four or fewer (non-overlapping) groups. Everyone within each group
will be offered the same price. Our goal is to choose the groups and prices
optimally to maximize our total sales revenue.
</p><p>
Create a class Pricing that contains a method maxSales that takes a vector &lt;int&gt; 
<b>price</b> containing the highest price that each potential customer is willing 
to pay, and returns the maximum sales revenue we can generate by 
differentiating our customers into four or fewer groups.

   (We can put the customer who is willing to pay 1 into any of these groups 
since he will not buy anything at these prices.)
